# CANUDRO üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Cerebro


### Team Members

- Member 2: Amishad Martn - SSET
- Member 3: Aneeja J - SSET

### Project Description
The project is basically a platform that allow people to draw in random canvases which keep getting swapped at random time interval with other canvases in realtime 
It's completely built using react native. This feature allows us to connect with the public for no use. We can even draw untill we get back our canvas. this platform is just for killing time.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if people want to see someone else's artwork and wish to contribute something of their own in that?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
whenever we start drawing the canvas will change rapidly within a random time range and we can see others artwork and let our signature be on it

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- React

on clicking the start button the canvas appears where we can draw upto our wish according to the colour we pick and size of the brush. The canvas gets swapped automatically.
